## 2. Question of the Day (Daily Engagement)

### The System

**Every day at 7am**, post 1 question on Instagram Stories:

```
Q: What's the difference between "fue" and "era"?
A) Completed action vs ongoing state
B) Past tense vs present
C) Something else?

Comment your answer! 🙋‍♀️
```

### Why It Works

- Students engage daily
- You stay top-of-mind
- You understand what confuses students
- Low effort, high value

### Content Idea List (Copy & Paste for 30 Days)

**Week 1: CSEC Common Mistakes**
1. "Preterite vs Imperfect: Which goes here? → fue/era confusion"
2. "Ser vs Estar: How do you know? → ser for permanent, estar for location"
3. "Present vs Preterite: What's the rule? → just happened vs routine"
4. "Reflexive verbs: Why the 'se'? → action on self"
5. "Subjunctive mood: When do you use it? → doubt, desire, emotion"
6. "Adjective agreement: Where does the accent? → gender/number match"
7. "Prepositions: Por vs Para? → by/for intention"

**Week 2: CAPE Complex Grammar**
8. "Conditional tense: When & how? → if scenarios"
9. "Perfect tenses: Haber + past participle why? → recent actions"
10. "Subjunctive in clauses: Cuando vs Cuando? → certainty matters"
11. "Passive voice: Too formal? → when exams use it"
12. "Indirect object pronouns: le vs le? → dative confusion"
13. "Question formation: Inversion needed? → yes/no vs info questions"
14. "Negation: Double negative rule? → no... nada"

**Week 3: Exam Strategy**
15. "Reading Comp: Skim or read? → context clues first"
16. "Listening: Take notes or just listen? → bullet points, not transcription"
17. "Essay: How many paragraphs? → intro, 2 body, conclusion"
18. "Speaking: Pronunciation or fluency? → both matter equally"
19. "Writing: Verb tenses to risk? → stick to tenses you know"
20. "Time management: How long per section? → reading 20 min, listening 15 min"
21. "Exam day: Coffee or no? → stay hydrated, light breakfast"

**Week 4: Student Fears**
22. "I'm way behind. Can I still pass? → yes, 12-week intensive exists"
23. "I always freeze when speaking. Help? → practice 2x weekly minimum"
24. "My accent is bad. Will they mark me down? → accent ≠ fluency"
25. "I don't like Spanish. Is tutoring worth it? → yes, because grade > feelings"
26. "How much practice is enough? → 5 hours/week minimum"
27. "I keep failing verb tenses. Any shortcuts? → no, but patterns exist"
28. "Can I pass without studying? → no, but you don't need 6 hours/day"
29. "How do I stop translating in my head? → immersion practice"
30. "Will AI replace tutors? → no, but AI can help you study"
