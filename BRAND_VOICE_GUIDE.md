## Examples You Can Use

### Instagram Post: Study Tips

```
Struggling with verb tenses? You're not alone.

Here's what I tell my 500+ students: Don't try to memorize every conjugation. Instead, focus on the 10 most-used verbs and the 3 main tenses.

Start there. Master those. Then expand.

The students who improve fastest aren't the smartest—they're the ones who study SMART.

What's your biggest grammar struggle? 👇
```

### Blog Post Intro

```
70% of CSEC students make the same 5 mistakes on their exams.

I know this because I've taught 500+ students and corrected these mistakes hundreds of times.

The good news? These mistakes are completely fixable. In fact, fixing just these 5 things often improves grades by a full letter.

Here's what they are (and how to fix them):
```

### Email Subject Lines

```
Subject: "Why Your Spanish Essays Get Marked Down"
Subject: "How Asha Improved from D to A (In 12 Weeks)"
Subject: "The Verb Tense Rule Examiners Want You to Know"
Subject: "Is Tutoring Worth It? Real Talk"
Subject: "What Happens on CSEC Exam Day (You Should Know)"
```

### YouTube Video Intro

```
Hi, I'm Candice. I've taught 500+ students and I see the same fear over and over: students terrified of the speaking exam.

In the next 7 minutes, I'm going to show you exactly why you don't need to be scared—and the 5 phrases examiners love.

Let's go.
